# Ford GoBike Service Data Exploration

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing 
system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data set was made available by
Udacity for the purpose of the project.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there are more males and female in the users of
the services, though it was observed that females have the highest duration per trip.
Also, I found out that we have more subscriber compared to one-time customers, and the
services usage occurs mostly aroung 7-9am and 5-7pm which shows why we have more subscribers. 
Most of the service users use it for transporting themself to their place of work or school
In addition, most of the bike usage happens during the week and we have less usage during
the weekends.
Finally,a larger percentage of the users prefer not sharing their bikes, since most of 
them use it as their means of transportation.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the data exploration. I start by showing the gender 
distribution of the users and the average bike trip duration of usage.

Afterwards, I did bivariate and multivariate data exploration. Checking for bike 
usage per day based on user type, bike usage per day based on gender, Hourly Duration
Usage with respect to gender etc.
I've made sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it
is clear that they're different between plots.
